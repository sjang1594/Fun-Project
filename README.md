# Fun Collaboration Project 

This repo is for both [Nick Jang](https://github.com/sjang1594) and [Khanh Vong](https://github.com/kvong).


## Ideas
- Image Processing with [OpenCV.js](https://docs.opencv.org/4.4.0/df/df7/tutorial_js_table_of_contents_setup.html)
- 
- 


## Analysis
- What models/weight would give a better result than others - use of dnn.
- Automatic recognization using manual openCV method, such as back ground substitution.
    * [Background Subtraction](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d1/dc5/tutorial_background_subtraction.html)

## To do list : 
- Curate the data such as formulas/Equation that used up until calculus II
    * Integration, Deriviation, Summation forumla(sigma), Taylor Series, and etc...
